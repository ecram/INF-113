    <p style="color: blue; font-size: 120%;">Practicing HTML is fun. <em>So far</em> we have learned <strong>HTML</strong> 
        is that help us describe how we want our webpages to look. We have tried the 
        head, title, H (heading) and paragraph tags so far. Very few people know all 
        the tags in HTML, but that is okey because we can do a lot with just some basic tags.
        We can learn about new tags when we need then.</p>
